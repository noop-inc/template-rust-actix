# Rust Template for Noop

This repsitory contains a Noop Template and code to get started using the [Actix web framework](https://actix.rs) for Rust.

We wrote a [complete guide](https://noop.dev/blog/launch-rust-app/) on getting this Template up and running.

The boilerplate code is derived from the [Postgres example](https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/databases/postgres) published by the Actix Framework maintainers.

The Blueprint at [.noop/blueprint.yaml](./.noop/blueprint.yaml) builds and runs an optimized production release from [src/main.rs](./src/main.rs)

# Run locally

Running the API locally requires [installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) then starting it with `cargo run`.
